# LLM Tool Calling Performance Analysis

> **Last Updated**: October 20, 2025

## Executive Summary

OpenAI GPT-5 family models exhibit **iterative reasoning behavior** that causes multiple tool invocations for single queries, resulting in 10-12x slower performance compared to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. This significantly impacts user experience and cost for tool-enabled agents.

**Key Finding**: For agents with tool calling (vector search, web search), **prefer Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** over GPT-5/GPT-5 Mini unless specific GPT-5 reasoning capabilities are required.

## Performance Comparison

### Test Scenario: Healthcare Agent with Vector Search
Query: "What cardiology services do you offer?"

| Model | Response Time | Vector Searches | Cost/Request | Tool Behavior |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **google/gemini-2.5-flash** | **4.0s** | 1 | ~$0.00007 | Single, efficient search |
| openai/gpt-5-mini | 37.4s | 2-3 | ~$0.0030 | Iterative refinement |
| openai/gpt-5 | 48.9s | 3 | ~$0.0195 | Iterative refinement |

**Performance Delta**:
- Gemini is **9-12x faster** than GPT-5 family
- Gemini is **43-278x cheaper** than GPT-5 family
- Gemini makes **1/3 the number** of database calls

## Root Cause: GPT-5 Advanced Reasoning

GPT-5's "advanced reasoning" feature causes **iterative tool calling**:

```
GPT-5 Behavior:
1. LLM Call #1: "I need to search for cardiology info"
   → Vector Search #1
2. LLM Call #2: "Results mention general services, let me search more specifically"
   → Vector Search #2
3. LLM Call #3: "Still not specific enough, refining query"
   → Vector Search #3
4. LLM Call #4: "Now I can formulate response"

Gemini 2.5 Flash Behavior:
1. LLM Call #1: "I need to search for cardiology info"
   → Vector Search #1
2. LLM Call #2: "Here's the response based on results"
```

**Analysis**: GPT-5 is "over-thinking" simple tool use cases, treating each search as an opportunity to refine strategy rather than executing once and synthesizing results.

## Verified Test Results

### Test Environment
- **Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Tool**: `backend/tests/manual/test_data_integrity.py`
- **Agents Tested**: 5 multi-tenant agents
- **Query Type**: Healthcare information with vector search

### Detailed Timing Breakdown (Wyckoff Agent)

#### GPT-5 (48.9s total):
```
12:262  chat openai/gpt-5                    → 3.7s
15:914  running tool: vector_search          → 1.6s
17:494  chat openai/gpt-5                    → 9.6s
27:126  running tool: vector_search          → 1.7s
28:802  chat openai/gpt-5                    → 20.9s
```
**3 LLM calls + 2 vector searches**

#### Gemini 2.5 Flash (4.0s total):
```
08:688  chat google/gemini-2.5-flash         → 0.6s
09:278  running tool: vector_search          → 0.8s
10:057  chat google/gemini-2.5-flash         → 2.6s
```
**2 LLM calls + 1 vector search**

## Impact on Agent Design

### ✅ **Recommended: Gemini 2.5 Flash**

**Use for**:
- Vector search agents (RAG)
- Web search agents
- Database query agents
- Any tool-enabled agent requiring fast response times
- Production-facing user interfaces

**Benefits**:
- Single-pass tool execution
- Sub-5 second response times
- Cost-effective at scale
- Excellent tool calling support
- No over-reasoning

### ⚠️ **Use GPT-5 Only When**:

- Advanced multi-step reasoning is required
- User is willing to wait 30-50 seconds
- Cost is not a concern (~40-280x more expensive)
- Latency tolerance is high (backend processing)
- Iterative refinement is desired behavior

### ❌ **Avoid for**:

- User-facing chat interfaces with tools
- Real-time applications
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Simple Q&A with vector search

## Current Agent Configurations

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **wyckoff/wyckoff_info_chat1** | google/gemini-2.5-flash | Healthcare queries need <5s response |
| **agrofresh/agro_info_chat1** | google/gemini-2.5-flash | Agricultural product search |
| default_account/simple_chat1 | moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905 | No tools, general chat |
| default_account/simple_chat2 | openai/gpt-oss-120b | No tools, research purposes |
| acme/acme_chat1 | mistral/mistral-nemo | No tools, baseline testing |

**Pattern**: All tool-enabled agents use Gemini 2.5 Flash for optimal performance.

## Future LLM Selection Guidelines

### Decision Matrix

```
Does agent use tools (vector search, web search, etc.)?
├─ YES
│  ├─ User-facing? → Use Gemini 2.5 Flash
│  ├─ Background processing? → Use Gemini 2.5 Flash (unless reasoning needed)
│  └─ Complex reasoning required? → Consider GPT-5, warn about latency
│
└─ NO (direct LLM response only)
   ├─ Fast response needed? → Gemini 2.5 Flash, Kimi K2, Mistral
   ├─ Quality priority? → GPT-5, Claude 4.5
   └─ Cost sensitive? → Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek
```

### Key Principle

> **For tool-enabled agents, tool execution efficiency matters more than LLM reasoning depth.**

A 4-second response with 85% quality beats a 45-second response with 95% quality in user-facing applications.
