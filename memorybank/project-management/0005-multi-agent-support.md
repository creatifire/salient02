# Epic 0005 - Multi-Agent Support

> Goal: Implement multi-agent infrastructure with intelligent routing, tool calling, and specialized agent endpoints to support different agent types with distinct capabilities and workflows.

## Scope & Approach

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Specialized Agents**: Different agents with distinct capabilities, tools, and knowledge domains
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic agent selection based on query intent and context
- **Tool Integration**: Agent-specific tool calling and workflow orchestration
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across agent handoffs

## Core Architectural Question: Agent Endpoint Strategy

### The Challenge
When implementing multiple agents with different:
- **Workflows**: Customer service vs. technical support vs. sales
- **Tool Access**: Database queries vs. API calls vs. file operations
- **Knowledge Domains**: Product docs vs. support tickets vs. company policies
- **Response Patterns**: Structured data vs. conversational vs. analytical

**How should we structure the API endpoints?**

### Option 1: Single Unified Endpoint with Agent Routing
```
POST /chat
{
  "message": "What's the status of order #12345?",
  "agent": "customer-service",  // Optional: explicit agent selection
  "context": {...}
}

// System automatically routes to appropriate agent based on:
// - Explicit agent parameter
// - Intent classification of message
// - Conversation history and context
// - User permissions and role
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent API interface for all chat interactions
- ✅ Transparent agent switching within conversations
- ✅ Simplified frontend integration (same endpoint for all)
- ✅ Intelligent routing can optimize agent selection
- ✅ Easy A/B testing of routing algorithms

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex routing logic in single endpoint
- ❌ Harder to implement agent-specific rate limiting
- ❌ Difficult to version individual agent capabilities
- ❌ All agents must share same request/response schema

### Option 2: Dedicated Endpoints per Agent
```
POST /agents/customer-service/chat
POST /agents/technical-support/chat  
POST /agents/sales-assistant/chat
POST /agents/document-analyst/chat

// Each endpoint optimized for specific agent:
// - Agent-specific request/response schemas
// - Specialized validation and preprocessing
// - Agent-specific rate limiting and monitoring
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- ✅ Agent-specific optimizations and configurations
- ✅ Independent versioning and deployment per agent
- ✅ Granular monitoring and rate limiting
- ✅ Easy to add new agents without affecting existing ones

**Cons:**
- ❌ Frontend must know which agent to call
- ❌ Complex conversation handoffs between agents
- ❌ Potential inconsistencies across agent interfaces
- ❌ More complex routing at application layer

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Smart Routing
```
// Primary unified endpoint with intelligent routing
POST /chat
{
  "message": "Help me with my order",
  "preferred_agent": "customer-service",  // Optional hint
  "allow_handoff": true                   // Allow agent switching
}

// Specialized endpoints for direct agent access
POST /agents/{agent-id}/chat
{
  "message": "Run SQL query on orders table",
  "tools": ["database", "analytics"],
  "force_agent": true  // Prevent automatic routing away
}

// Agent discovery and capabilities
GET /agents
GET /agents/{agent-id}/capabilities
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds: unified interface + specialized access
- ✅ Flexibility for different client use cases
- ✅ Progressive enhancement (start simple, add specialized later)
- ✅ Clear agent boundaries while maintaining routing intelligence

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex API surface to maintain
- ❌ Potential confusion about which endpoint to use
- ❌ Risk of feature duplication between endpoints

## Questions for Architectural Decision

### 1. **Agent Discovery & Capabilities**
- How should clients discover available agents and their capabilities?
- Should agent capabilities be static (config) or dynamic (runtime discovery)?
- How do we handle agent availability and fallback strategies?

### 2. **Context & State Management**
- How do we maintain conversation context when switching between agents?
- Should agents share conversation history or maintain separate contexts?
- How do we handle agent-specific context (e.g., customer service case ID)?

### 3. **Tool Access & Security**
- Should tool access be agent-specific or user/session-specific?
- How do we prevent agents from accessing unauthorized tools or data?
- Should tool calling be logged/audited per agent or per conversation?

### 4. **Performance & Scaling**
- Should each agent type have dedicated infrastructure resources?
- How do we handle different latency requirements (fast chat vs. deep analysis)?
- Should we implement agent-specific caching strategies?

### 5. **Monitoring & Analytics**
- How granular should agent performance monitoring be?
- Should we track agent handoff patterns and success rates?
- How do we measure agent effectiveness and user satisfaction per agent type?

### 6. **Version Management**
- How do we handle agent updates and backward compatibility?
- Should agents have independent version lifecycles?
- How do we coordinate updates across dependent agents?

### 7. **Configuration Management**
- Should each agent have its own dedicated YAML configuration file complementary to app.yaml?
- How do we balance centralized configuration (app.yaml) vs. agent-specific configuration files?
- Should agent configurations be hot-reloadable or require deployment restarts?
- How do we handle configuration inheritance and overrides between global and agent-specific settings?
- Should agent configurations be versioned independently or tied to application versions?

## Proposed Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Understand different agent use cases and requirements
- **Use Case Mapping**: Document specific workflows and tool requirements per agent type
- **Performance Requirements**: Define latency, throughput, and accuracy requirements
- **Integration Analysis**: Assess frontend and external system integration needs

### Phase 2: Prototype & Validation
- **Simple Multi-Agent POC**: Implement 2-3 basic agents with different approaches
- **Endpoint Pattern Testing**: Try both unified and dedicated endpoint patterns
- **Context Handoff Testing**: Validate conversation continuity across agent switches
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure latency and resource usage patterns

### Phase 3: Architecture Decision
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Document pros/cons of each approach with real data
- **Stakeholder Review**: Present findings and get feedback on preferred approach
- **Technical Decision**: Choose endpoint strategy with clear rationale
- **Migration Plan**: If changing from current approach, plan transition strategy

## Recommended Starting Point

### Immediate Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

Start with **Option 3 (Hybrid)** for these reasons:

1. **Evolutionary Path**: Begin with unified endpoint, add specialized as needed
2. **Flexibility**: Supports both simple and complex use cases
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Can fall back to single approach if hybrid proves too complex
4. **User Choice**: Different clients can choose appropriate level of complexity

### Implementation Sequence:
1. **Phase 1**: Implement unified `/chat` endpoint with basic agent routing
2. **Phase 2**: Add agent discovery endpoints (`GET /agents`)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement specialized agent endpoints (`POST /agents/{id}/chat`)
4. **Phase 4**: Add advanced routing and handoff capabilities

### Success Metrics:
- **Developer Experience**: Easy to integrate for simple use cases
- **Flexibility**: Supports advanced agent-specific workflows
- **Performance**: Meets latency requirements for all agent types
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and monitoring

## Research Questions for Further Investigation

### Technical Architecture
1. **Agent Registry**: Should we implement a dynamic agent registry service?
2. **Load Balancing**: How do we distribute load across multiple instances of the same agent?
3. **Circuit Breakers**: How do we handle agent failures and implement fallbacks?
4. **Streaming**: Should all agents support streaming responses or only specific ones?
5. **Configuration Architecture**: Should agents have dedicated config files (e.g., `agents/sales-agent.yaml`) vs. centralized in `app.yaml`?

### Business Logic
1. **Agent Specialization**: What's the optimal level of agent specialization vs. generalization?
2. **User Experience**: Should users be aware of agent switching or should it be transparent?
3. **Training Data**: How do we manage training data and fine-tuning per agent type?
4. **Cost Optimization**: How do we balance cost vs. capability across different agent types?

### Integration Patterns
1. **Tool Orchestration**: Should agents orchestrate tools directly or through a separate service?
2. **External APIs**: How do we handle rate limiting and authentication for agent tool calls?
3. **Database Access**: Should agents have direct database access or go through APIs?
4. **Event Streaming**: Should agent actions generate events for analytics and monitoring?
