# Project Management Archive

> **Created**: January 12, 2025  
> **Last Updated**: January 12, 2025  
> This archive contains completed, superseded, and planning documentation from project development.

## Purpose

This folder preserves project management documents (epics, tasks, features) organized into three categories:
- **Completed**: Successfully finished epics from early project phases
- **Superseded**: Replaced by consolidated or improved approaches
- **Planning**: Ad-hoc planning documents, brainstorming, and demo implementations

These documents provide valuable historical context for understanding project evolution and architectural decisions.

## Archive Contents

### üìÅ `completed/` - Successfully Finished Epics

Epics that were completed in early project phases and are no longer actively referenced in current development.

**Epic 0001 - Preliminary Design**
- **File**: `completed/0001-preliminary-design.md`
- **Date Completed**: Early 2025 (Phase 0)
- **Status**: Foundation work completed, informed later architecture
- **Content**: Initial design and architecture planning for the chat system
- **Value**: Historical context for early architectural decisions
- **Successor**: Design evolved into Epic 0004 (Chat Memory), Epic 0017 (Simple Chat), Epic 0022 (Multi-Tenant)

**Epic 0002 - Baseline Connectivity**
- **File**: `completed/0002-baseline-connectivity.md`
- **Date Completed**: Early 2025 (Phase 0)
- **Status**: Basic connectivity and infrastructure established
- **Content**: OpenRouter integration, FastAPI setup, basic request/response flow
- **Value**: Shows initial technical decisions and baseline implementation
- **Successor**: Evolved into Pydantic AI-based agent architecture

### üìÅ `superseded/` - Replaced by Newer Consolidated Epics

Epics that were replaced by improved or consolidated approaches during active development.

**Epic 0017 - Simple Chat Agent (Original)**
- **File**: `superseded/0017-simple-chat-agent-old.md` (35KB, 734 lines)
- **Date Archived**: September 2025
- **Status**: Superseded by Epic 0022 (Multi-Tenant Architecture)
- **Reason**: Epic 0022 consolidated the multi-tenant architecture and simplified the implementation approach. The original Epic 0017 described a more complex, phase-based implementation that was streamlined in the actual development.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Original: Multi-phase agent factory, complex routing, registry system
  - New Approach: Explicit URL structure, hybrid DB + config files, no complex routing
  - Consolidation: Multi-tenant features integrated directly into Epic 0022
- **Value**: Shows the evolution from complex over-engineered approach to simple, explicit architecture
- **Lesson Learned**: Avoid premature abstraction - explicit URLs eliminated need for complex routing

## Current Project Management Documentation

For active project management documentation, see:

- **Development Approach**: `/memorybank/project-management/0000-approach-milestone-01.md`
- **Master Epic List**: `/memorybank/project-management/0000-epics.md`
- **Active Epics**: `/memorybank/project-management/00XX-*.md` (all numbered epic files)
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: `/memorybank/project-management/0022-multi-tenant-architecture.md` (current implementation)

## Related Archives

**Architecture Documentation Archive**: `/memorybank/archive/`
- Contains archived architecture and design documents (not epics)
- See `/memorybank/archive/README.md` for architecture archive contents

## When to Archive Project Management Documents

Epic or task files should be moved to this archive when:

1. **Superseded**: A new epic replaces or consolidates the old approach
2. **Completed**: Epic finished and implementation stable (optional - some teams prefer to keep completed epics in main folder)
3. **Approach Changed**: Fundamental shift in implementation strategy makes old planning obsolete
4. **Historical Reference Only**: Document no longer guides active development but provides valuable context

## Archive Guidelines

- **Don't Update**: Archived documents are historical snapshots - don't modify them
- **Cross-Reference**: Link from current epics to archived ones when relevant (e.g., "See archived Epic 0017 for original approach")
- **Preserve Context**: Keep commit history and file metadata intact
- **Update This README**: Add entries when archiving new documents

## Retrieval

If you need to reference archived epics:
1. Check current epics first - they may reference or incorporate archived content
2. Review this README for quick overview and supersession notes
3. Read archived files with historical context in mind
4. Consider whether archived approach has relevant ideas for current challenges
