## Technical Architecture

### Public Chat Infrastructure
```
Public User (No Auth) → Rate Limiter → Content Filter → Public Chat Agent → Knowledge Base
                                                                        ↓
Anonymous Session ← Session Manager ← Response Filter ← LLM Provider ← Lead Capture
```

### Configuration Schema (app.yaml)
```yaml
public_chat:
  enabled: true
  rate_limiting:
    requests_per_minute: 10
    requests_per_hour: 100
    burst_allowance: 3
  content_moderation:
    provider: "azure"  # azure, openai, custom
    strict_mode: true
    block_on_violation: true
  session_management:
    max_duration_hours: 2
    cleanup_interval_minutes: 30
    max_anonymous_sessions: 1000
  lead_capture:
    auto_qualify: true
    qualification_threshold: 3  # interactions before qualifying
    crm_integration: true
```

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention and automatic deletion
- **Privacy Controls**: Clear privacy notices and consent management
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of public interactions for compliance

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching of common responses and FAQ content
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute anonymous sessions across multiple instances
- **Resource Limits**: Per-session resource limits to prevent abuse
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of public chat usage and performance

## Success Criteria
1. **Accessibility**: Any visitor can start chatting immediately without barriers
2. **Safety**: Content moderation prevents inappropriate interactions
3. **Performance**: Fast response times even with high anonymous traffic
4. **Lead Generation**: Effective capture and qualification of potential customers
5. **Scalability**: System handles thousands of concurrent anonymous sessions
6. **Compliance**: Meets privacy and data protection requirements

This epic enables broad public access to chat functionality while maintaining security, performance, and business value through effective lead capture and customer support.
