Simple Chat Agent Template - CLEANED UP FOR PHASE 3

The overengineered components (950+ lines) have been removed in Phase 0 cleanup:
- ChatResponse model (209 lines) - REMOVED
- SimpleChatAgent wrapper (305 lines) - REMOVED  
- Factory system (390 lines) - REMOVED
- Complex imports and __all__ exports - REMOVED

This module will be reimplemented in Phase 3 with clean Pydantic AI patterns:
- Direct Agent() usage following official documentation
- YAML-based configuration loading
- Simple string responses (no complex models)
- ~65 lines total vs 950+ previously

TODO Phase 3: Implement clean simple_chat agent following 0017-simple-chat-agent.md

# Clean slate - no imports until Phase 3 implementation
