  guidance: |
    **When users ask about contacting departments:**
    1. Search by department NAME using the `query` parameter (not filters!)
       Example: search_directory(list_name="contact_information", query="Cardiology")
    2. Search by service_type using `filters` ONLY if searching by category
       Example: search_directory(list_name="contact_information", filters={"service_type": "Emergency Services"})
    3. Always include hours_of_operation in response
    4. If user asks for email/fax/phone specifically, ensure that field is in the result
