  guidance: |
    **When users ask about products:**
    1. Search by CATEGORY first (e.g., "mobility aids", "diagnostic equipment")
    2. Search by product NAME or TYPE (e.g., "wheelchair", "blood pressure monitor")
    3. Use FILTERS for specific requirements (e.g., in_stock=true, price range)
    4. Always include availability status (in_stock) in results
