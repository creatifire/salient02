    2. Prioritize items with high conversion_rate
    3. Show items marked frequently_bought_together first
    4. Explain WHY the items work together (include reason)

    - user_query: "What accessories for blood pressure monitor?"
      tool_calls:

      tool_calls:
        - 'search_directory(list_name="cross_sell", filters={"primary_item": "Wheelchair", "frequently_bought_together": "true"})'
