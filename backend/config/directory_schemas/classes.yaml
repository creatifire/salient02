# Search strategy
search_strategy:
  natural_language: |
    When users ask about classes or events:
    
    1. Identify event type: recurring class vs one-time seminar
    2. Look for schedule preferences (day of week, time, duration)
    3. Consider cost preferences (free vs paid)
    4. Match delivery format (in-person, online, hybrid)
    5. Check target audience and prerequisites
    6. Search by instructor if mentioned
    7. Look for program/series if part of a sequence
